### Notes

Routes are finished and working properly. (password verification still needs more stringent requirements update)  
Documentation is finished and hosted.  
!!! __Postman tests are incomplete and not yet added to the repo__ !!!  

### Misc

To generate documentation, type "apidoc -i src/ -o docs/" in terminal  

To run, type "docker compose up" in terminal, then visit page at localhost:4000
